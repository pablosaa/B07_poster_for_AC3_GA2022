	\item In which way does the coupling/decoupling of clouds to moisture-layers impact the cloud's properties?

Daily sea ice lead fraction (LF) is obtained from space-borne observations based on the divergence calculations from consecutive Sentinel-1 SAR scenes~\refp{bib:vonAlbedyll2021}. Additionally, sea ice concentration (SIC) is also provided by the University of Bremen~\refp{bib:Ludwig2021}. Fig.~\ref{fig:lf_sic} summarizes the LF and SIC during the period of interest.

\colouredcircle Sea ice - atmosphere coupling conceptual model\\
Vertical gradient of water vapour transport ($\nabla WVT$) is calculated from specific humidity $q_v~\mathrm{[g~g^{-1}]}$ and horizontal wind $\vec{v}_w~\mathrm{[m~s^{-1}]}$ from radiosonde profiles, following
\begin{equation}
	\nabla \mathrm{WVT} = -\frac{10^2}{g}~|q_v\cdot \vec{v}_w|~\frac{dP}{dz}
\end{equation}
The direction of maximum transport (see grey lines in Fig.~\ref{fig:lf_sic}) is used to relate LF with zenith observations at \polarstern.

The PBLH is used as top layer from which the maximum $\nabla WVT$ is localized downwards. To have a rough estimation of PBLH, the bulk Richardson number defined as
\begin{equation}
	Ri_b(z)\,=\,\frac{g}{\theta_v}\frac{\Delta \theta_v \,\Delta z}{\left( \Delta u \right)^2\,+\,\left(\Delta v \right)^2}
	\label{eq:Rib}
\end{equation}
with $g$ is the constant of gravity 9.81~$\rm m~s^{-2}$, $\theta_v$ is the virtual potential temperature profile
in K, $\Delta \theta_v\,=\,\theta_v-\theta_v(z_0)$, $\Delta u\,=\,u-u_0$, and $\Delta v\,=\,v-v_0$, the horizontal wind components in $\rm m~s^{-1}$. The $\Delta z\,=\,z - z_0$ with $z$ the altitude of the atmosphere layers in $\rm m$ and the subscript $0$ indicating the surface reference.

\colouredcircle Cloud coupling classification: criteria based on the virtual potential temperature $\theta_v$ and location of maximum $\nabla~WVT$ below PBLH. The $\theta_v$ is analyzed to classify cases where the WVT is coupled or decoupled to the cloud.

From Fig.~\ref{fig:scatterWPLF} [a] a clear relationship of LWP and LF can be seen, the larger the LF the higher LWP, and the warmer the cloud top temperature too. For IWP (Fig.~\ref{fig:scatterWPLF} [b]) there is no relationship, with a wide range of IWP values the observed LF. The only clear feature is the clustering of points with coupled cases being gathered towards larger LF. Shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:scatterWPLF} [c] is the gradient of cloud temperature as defined by $\Gamma_{\rm cloud}=\frac{\Delta T}{\Delta H}$ (with $\Delta T=T_{top}-T_{bot}$ and $\Delta H=CTH-CBH$) vs. LF with colour-coded cloud thickness. The most negative $\Gamma_{\rm cloud}$ are closer to a moist adiabatic lapse-rates, whereas positive values indicates inversion at cloud top, however this is not consistent neither with increasing LF nor thickness since for coupled cases there are positive and negative $\Gamma_{\rm cloud}$ which is an indicator of other factors affecting it.

{\small
\begin{itemize}
		\item By coupling cloud observations with LF downwind with water vapour trasport as conveying mechanishm for the coupling, seems to be plausible,
		\item A positive relationship LWP and LF has been found, the same is not found for IWP or cloud temperature gradient,
		\item Larger LF are acompained by warmer cloud top, indicating a higher moisture content for those cases,
		\item It is confirmed that uncoupled clouds are mostly high level clouds~\ref{bib:garfias2021},
		\item SAR based LF at 700~, spatial resolution are crutial, the same results cannot be reproduce by usind passive SIC retrievals at 1~km resolution,
		%Results are consistent with previous findings regarding the effect of low sea ice concentration (e.g., due to the presence of leads or polynyas) on cloud micro- and macro-physical properties~[\ref{bib:garfias2021}].
		%\item Cloud properties like liquid and ice water path (LWP and IWP), cloud base height, and cloud geometrical thickness are also variables strongly influencing the surface radiation budget.
		%\item Our results depict a warming cloud effect on the surface is clearly enhanced by atmospheric thermodynamic and dynamic conditions which yiel coupling with the sea ice situation downwind.

Statistics based on this methodology are being prepared for the whole \mosaic wintertime expedition in order enrich the results based on this case study.
